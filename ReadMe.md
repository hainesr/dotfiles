# My dotfiles
## Robert Haines

### Usage

To install the dotfiles in `$HOME` run `make` in the root of this repository.

If you have any sensitive information (for example access keys, etc) you can put them in a file called `$HOME\.extra` and the `.bash_profile` in this setup will pull it in automatically. *Do not check in `.extra`!*
