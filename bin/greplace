# A sort of find/replace across multiple files. Quite useful for small
# changes in many files, such as changing the copyright year across a
# whole codebase. Changes are ultimately made in place, so this is a
# destructive action. USE WITH CAUTION!
#
# Usage: greplace xxx yyy file1 [file2 ... fileN]
#   Replaces all occurences of xxx with yyy in all files.
