# For each line of input (stdin) output a 'dot'. This is useful for monitoring
# the progress of a long running operation, without seeing all of its output
# streaming past.
#
# The 'dot' can be specified as the first parameter but defaults to '.'. If
# you want to use a character that has special significance in a shell
# environment  - such as #, &, |, *, \, and so on - then use quotes, e.g. '*'.
#
# Usage: some-script-with-lots-of-output | progress [dot]
